This API uses Express for all the routing and Mongoose to connect to MongoDB and define the data models. It includes three models — Cats, Owners, and Vets — and each one has full CRUD routes. The Cat model also connects to owners and vets using Mongoose references.

The cats route includes extra features like pagination, filtering, and sorting, so you can control how many results you get and search by breed or sort by different fields. I used try/catch blocks so errors don’t break the server, and everything runs through a global error‑handling middleware. There’s also a logger middleware that prints every request with a timestamp. The conn.js file handles connecting the database to MongoDB Compass, and the seed.js file is used to fill the database with sample data.
owner db, vetdb, and cats db. i included a seed.js. conn.js is connected.
